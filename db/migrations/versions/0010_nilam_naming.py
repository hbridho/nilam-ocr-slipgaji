"""The client's naming: schema `nilam_ocr_slipgaji`, every table prefixed with `nilam_`, rows included; and the
`system_prompt` table agreed for every NILAM document

Revision ID: 0010_nilam_naming
Revises: 0009_guardrails_results_sequence
Create Date: 2026-10-06

Upstream nilam-ocr-npwp took three steps to get here (0010 `public` -> `ocr_pipeline`, 0011 -> `ocr_pipeline_npwp`,
0013 -> `nilam_ocr_npwp` + `nilam_`); slip gaji goes in one. Every table of this repository moves from `public` to
`nilam_ocr_slipgaji` and gets the `nilam_` prefix: `public.ocr_jobs` becomes `nilam_ocr_slipgaji.nilam_ocr_jobs`,
`testing_ocr_jobs` becomes `nilam_testing_ocr_jobs`. Nothing is copied: `ALTER TABLE ... SET SCHEMA` and `RENAME`
change the catalog only, in the migration's one transaction. The names derived from the table name follow it
(indexes, primary keys, foreign keys, the sequences of the `id` columns), so they keep matching what PostgreSQL
and `tables.py` would give a new table.

Also, as upstream 0012: `threshold_target` is dropped from the guardrails verdict tables (a guardrails threshold
has one side now, accept). And `system_prompt` is created, in the team's DDL (6 Oct 2026): one row per version,
at most one `is_active`.

The version table is moved and renamed by `env.py` before any revision runs (`nilam_ocr_slipgaji_alembic_version`).
Containers on an image that still addresses `public` fail their queries between this migration and their
replacement: run it, then restart the services straight after.

The schema and table names are written out rather than taken from `tables.py`, so this revision keeps acting on
the names it was written for.
