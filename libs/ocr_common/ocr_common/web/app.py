API_CONVENTIONS = """

## Conventions (the same for every nilam-ocr service)

**Authentication.** Every endpoint except `/health`, `/ready` and `/metrics` requires the header `X-API-Key`.
A missing or wrong key answers `401`. The services are reachable only from inside the cluster.

**Envelope.** Every JSON response, success or error, has the same shape:
`{status_code, status_desc, message, data, errors, request_id}`. `status_code` always equals the HTTP
status. On success `errors` is null; on error `data` is null.

**Errors.** `errors` is a stable, machine-readable code; branch on it, not on the wording of `message`.
The document checks: `EMPTY_FILE`, `UNSUPPORTED_FILE_TYPE`, `UNREADABLE_FILE`, `TOO_MANY_PAGES`,
`INVALID_FILE_SOURCE`, `FILE_URL_REJECTED` (400), `FILE_TOO_LARGE` (413). Otherwise the code of the status:
`UNAUTHORIZED` (401), `REQUEST_ID_NOT_FOUND` (404, an unknown request_id), `NOT_FOUND` (404, a path that does
not exist), `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED` (405), `VALIDATION_ERROR` (422), `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` (500),
`DOWNSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` (503), `DOWNSTREAM_TIMEOUT` (504), unless an endpoint documents a more precise one.
`400` = the request or the document is unusable (do not retry unchanged). `503` / `504` are safe to retry.

**request_id.** Minted by the central orchestrator and carried through every stage. Where an endpoint has
no request_id of its own, the `X-Request-ID` request header is used (and echoed in the response header);
without it the service generates one.

**Asynchronous stages** (internal: only the orchestrator SLIP_GAJI and the previous stage call them). `POST
.../jobs` answers `202` immediately and does the work in the background. The outcome is reported by a
callback to the central orchestrator (see *Webhooks*), and can be read at any time with
`GET .../jobs/{request_id}`, which the orchestrator SLIP_GAJI's `GET /v1/extract-ocr/{request_id}` combines
over the three stages. Submitting the same request_id again is idempotent:
`202` with `duplicate: true`, the work is not repeated, unless the earlier attempt `FAILED` or has been
`PROCESSING` for longer than the job lease (`PIPELINE_JOB_LEASE_SECONDS`, 5 minutes by default: the
process running it died). A job still running when the service shuts down is reported `FAILED`. Because
the request was already answered `202`, a problem with the document itself (unreadable file, no text,
unsupported document type) shows up as a `FAILED` job and callback, not as a `4xx`.
