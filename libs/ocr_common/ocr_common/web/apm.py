"""Elastic APM: a trace of every HTTP request and every background job, with the calls they make (httpx to the
other services, asyncpg / SQLAlchemy to the database), sent to the APM server at `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL`.

Without `ELASTIC_APM_SERVER_URL` the agent is not loaded at all and every function here does nothing, so a
service without an APM server (local, CI, a cluster where it is not set up yet) runs exactly as before.

Request and response bodies and headers are never captured: the documents and their fields (names, salaries)
must not leave for the APM server, and neither must the API keys. Every transaction carries the `request_id`
label, the same id as in the logs, and JSON log lines carry `trace.id` / `transaction.id` while one is active.
