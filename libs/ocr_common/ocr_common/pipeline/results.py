"""Reading what an earlier stage stored, for hand-offs by reference.

With `PIPELINE_HANDOFF_BY_REFERENCE` the sender leaves the big parts (OCR blocks, structured fields)
out of the hand-off body and the outbox row; the receiving stage reads them from `<prefix>_results`
of the shared database instead. The payload then only carries `request_id`, `document_type` and the
guardrails report.

The SQLAlchemy implementation lives in `results_sql` so that this module, which the package exports,
stays importable by a service without a database (the orchestrator)."""
