"""The asynchronous pipeline shared by the stage services: claim a job, run it in the background,
store the result, notify the orchestrator, hand the job to the next stage.

Modules:
  stage           StagePipeline, the per-service orchestration of one job
  sequence        pipeline_name_sequence: which services a request runs, and in which order
  repository      job status storage: Protocol, in-memory, and (repository_sql) PostgreSQL
  callbacks       HTTP callback to the orchestrator and hand-off to the next stage, with retries
  runner          background tasks and graceful drain on shutdown
  outbox          transactional outbox: messages written with the result, delivered by OutboxRelay
  outcomes        the orchestrator's own outcome row (ORCHESTRATION_OUTCOME_TABLE)
  outbox_status   schema and handler behind each service's GET /v1/<stage>/outbox
  results         reading an earlier stage's stored result (hand-off by reference; SQL in results_sql)
  reaper          running again the jobs a dead process left PROCESSING
  schemas         Pydantic models of the payloads passed between stages and to the orchestrator
  factory         build_* helpers that wire all of the above from settings
  tables/database SQLAlchemy tables and engine (need the `db` extra)

Nothing imported here may import SQLAlchemy at module level: the orchestrator uses this package without the
`db` extra. The SQL implementations (*_sql modules, database, tables) are imported lazily by the
factory; tests/test_imports.py enforces it.
