"""Where a service loads a model file from: its local path (baked in the image, or `weights/` on a laptop),
or, with a `gs://` URI configured, the object downloaded from GCS at start and verified (ocr_common.clients.gcs).

The download uses GCP Workload Identity Federation with Entra ID (ocr_common.clients.gcp): AZURE_TENANT_ID,
AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, GCP_PROJECT_NUMBER, GCP_POOL_ID, GCP_PROVIDER_ID, GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL
(Tim SEA's GCS identity). Without them, Application Default Credentials are used when the host has them: on a GCE
VM (slip gaji's dev target, gc-bribrain-dev-gce-facematch-01) that is the VM's own service account, which then
needs read access to the bucket. No credentials at all, or a download that fails or does not match its SHA-256,
stops the start: a service never runs with a half-downloaded or corrupted model. The object at the URI is replaced
when a new model is uploaded; pods take it when they restart.
