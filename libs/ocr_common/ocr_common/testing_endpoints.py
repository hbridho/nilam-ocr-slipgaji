"""Names of the testing endpoints (`TESTING_ENDPOINTS`), shared by the services.

Each endpoint of the pipeline has a `-test` twin that runs the same code on copies of the stage tables
(`testing_ocr_jobs`, ..., `testing_pipeline_outbox`), without callbacks and without writes to the
orchestrator's tables. The ML team uses them for load tests on dev. No dependency beyond the standard
library: the orchestrator imports it without SQLAlchemy.
