"""Domain errors of the services. Each carries the HTTP status it maps to, and `create_app` turns
any of them into the standard error envelope in one exception handler, so routes and services raise
and never translate.

Use the named subclasses when raising; `ServiceError(status_code, message)` itself is for the one
case where the status is data (a remote service's 4xx passed through unchanged).

`code` is the stable, machine-readable value of the envelope's `errors` (the API spec's Error Codes): the
client branches on it, never on the wording of `message`. Without one, `error_code` falls back to the code of
the status."""
